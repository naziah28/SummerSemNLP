    "processed_docs = preprocess(\"Perhaps Skinner was a flamboyant cheerleader , as Leith suggested. His work, however, did have profound effects on educational thought in a number of ways related to the general concept of programmed learning. Attention was focussed first on the objectives of instruction in a general sense (Bloom et al., 1956), and then on the specific objectives of the behavioural objectives movement (Mager, 1962). The idea of mastery learning, popular in the 1930's but failing because of lack of a technology to sustain it (Block, 1971, p.4), was also resurrected as a corollary of programmed instruction, and with it evolved an interest in learning hierarchies and the structure of knowledge (Gagné and Paradise, 1961). These, in turn, have been influential in the development of systems of learning and instruction (Keller, 1968; Bloom, 1968) which have achieved the improvements in standards of learning which Skinner had hoped to bring about by his technological revolution. Here the emphasis has turned from technology in education, with its emphasis on hardware, to the technology of education. The 'Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1: The Cognitive Domain' (1956) arrived at a time when the demand for improvements in the efficiency of education was being made by Skinner and his colleagues. The idea for such a taxonomy came during a meeting of examiners attending the 1948 American Psychological Association Convention. Bloom and thirty three colleagues met over a five year period to discuss their taxonomy, which was then organised and written by a select committee of five members. The taxonomy was to provide a 'theoretical framework which could be used to facilitate communication among examiners.' It is intended to provide for classification of the goals of our educational system. It is expected to be of general help to all teachers, administrators, professional specialists , and research workers who deal with curricular and evaluation problems. It is especially intended to help them discuss these problems with greater precision. (Bloom et al., 1956, p.1) It was hoped that such ambiguous terms as 'really understand', 'internalize knowledge' and 'grasp the core or essence', would be redefined as a set of standard classifications, making exchange of information about curricular development and evaluation more precise. Equally important, the psychological relationships within the taxonomy were seen as forming a basis for psychological investigations to shed light on changes in the learner's behaviour. This aspect of the taxonomy has been pursued in various form\")\n",
